# CSE ASSIGNMENT 4

## Question 1:

> Write a C program to check whether the given number is an Adam’s square number or not

```c
// Program to find if the given number is an Adam number

#include <stdio.h>

int reverse(int a)
{    
    int i = 0, rem;
    
    while (a != 0)
    {
        rem = a % 10;
        a = a / 10;
        i = (i * 10) + rem;
    }

    return i;
}

int main()
{
    int a, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0;

    printf("Input the number to be tested: ");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    
    b = reverse(a);
    
    printf("The number and it's reverse is %d => %d", a,b);
    
    c = a * a;
    d = b * b;
    
    printf("\nThe square of the number and it's reverse is %d => %d", c,d);
    
    if (c == reverse(d))
    {
        printf("\nThe given number %d is an Adam's number\n", a);
    }
    else 
    {
        printf("\nThe given number %d is not an Adam's number\n", a);
    }
}

```

```
Input the number to be tested: 21
The number and it's reverse is 21 => 12
The square of the number and it's reverse is 441 => 144
The given number 21 is an Adam's number
```

## Question 2:

> write a C program to find the GCD of given two numbers and 
check the GCD value is equal to one then print as co-prime numbers. 
List out all possible co-prime numbers from 2 to 20

```c
// Program to find GCD of two prime numbers and print all co-primes from 2 - 20

#include <stdio.h>

    }
    else if (coprime_flag == 0)
    {
        printf("The GCD of %d and %d is %d\n", x, y, n2);
    }
}

{
    int i, j;
    
    for (i = 2; i <= num; i++)
    {
        for (j = i; j <= num; j++)
        {
            if (i == j)

            {   
                GCD(i, j, 1);
            }
        }
    }
}

find the perimeter for the corresponding shape with the assumption as below. 
Assume corresponding shape for the given user input
1- Square, 2- Rectangle, 3 – Triangle and 4 – Polygon

```c
// Program to calculate perimeter of an n-sided polygon based on user input

#include <stdio.h>

void perimeter (const int *choice)

## Question 4:

> Write a C Program to automate the price calculation process for a car show room. Get the showroom price, discount and road tax from the user. The GST for each car differs based on the show room price.
Show room price of car 		GST %
< 5 lakh			8 %
>= 5 lakh && < 10 lakh 		18 %
>= 10 lakh			28 %
Calculate the onroad price of the car. 
(onroad price = (showroom price + road tax + GST) – discount)
Repeat the calculation process for ‘n’ cars

```c
// Program to calcuate car price in the showroom

#include <stdio.h>

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int next;

    do
    {
        int car_price, road_tax, discount, gst;

        printf("Enter the price of the car : ");
        scanf("%d", &car_price);

        printf("Enter the amount of road tax : ");
        scanf("%d", &road_tax);

        printf("Enter the disount percentage : ");
        scanf("%d", &discount);

        if (car_price < 500000)
        {
            gst = 8 * (car_price / 100);
        }
        else if (car_price >= 500000 && car_price < 1000000)
        {
            gst = 18 * (car_price / 100);
        }
        else
        {
            gst = 28 * (car_price / 100);
        }

        printf("The on-road price of this car is : %d\n", (car_price + road_tax + gst) - (discount * (car_price / 100)));
        
        printf("Enter '1' if you want to continue : ");
        scanf("%d", &next);

        if (next != 1)
        {
            next = 0;
        }
    }while (next);
    
    return 0;
}
```

```
Enter the price of the car : 12000000
Enter the amount of road tax : 7000
Enter the disount percentage : 12
The on-road price of this car is : 13927000
Enter '1' if you want to continue : 0
```

## Question 5:

> write a c program to calculate electricity bill. 
Get customer id, previous unit and current unit.
 To calculate electricity bill, ask tariff choice 
(1.domestic, 2.commercial, 3.industry) from the user. 
Calculate electricity bill for the following power tariff and print the total amount
Category 	Unit Range  Charges(Rs)	
Domestic	0-100		2.75    
		101-500		4.50
		Above 500	5
Commercial 	0-200		5
		201-500		5.5
		Above 500	6
Industry			10
Ask the user “Do you want to continue?”, 
if the user press 1, the program will ask the user to enter customer details to calculate bill, 
otherwise the program will be closed

```c
