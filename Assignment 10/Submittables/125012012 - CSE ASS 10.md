## Problem 1

---

### Question:

> 1.Write a C program to calculate gross salary of employee using stucture with pointer.
Consider the following details for 5 employees:
employee name,empolyee id,experience, designation, department and basic salary.
1. if the basic salary is less than or equal to 20000 then HRA =9% of the basic salary and 
DA=11% of the basic salary.
2. if the basic salary is less than or equal to 30000 and greater than 20000 then 
HRA =20% of the basic salary and DA=21% of the basic salary. 
3. if the basic salary is above 50000 then HRA =25% of the basic salary and 
DA=30% of the basic salary.
Gross salary=Basic salary+HRA+DA
print the employee name,empolyee id,experience, designation, department and gross salary

### Code:

```c
// Program to calculate the gross salary of an empolyee based on set constraints

#include <stdio.h>

struct employee_table
{
    char name[100], id[10], designation[50], department[50];
    int exp, sal;
};

void get_emp_details(struct employee_table *empp)
{
    printf("Enter your name : ");
    scanf(" %s", empp->name);
    printf("Enter your ID : ");
    scanf(" %s", empp->id);
    printf("How much experience do you have : ");
    scanf(" %d", &empp->exp);
    printf("What are you designated as : ");
    scanf(" %s", empp->designation);
    printf("What department do you belong to : ");
    scanf(" %s", empp->department);
    printf("What is your monthly salary : ");
    scanf(" %d", &empp->sal);
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    struct employee_table emp[5];
    struct employee_table *empp = emp;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        get_emp_details(empp++);
    }

    empp = emp;

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        printf("------Employee %d------\n\n", i + 1);
        printf("Name : %s\n", empp->name);
        printf("ID : %s\n", empp->id);
        printf("Experience : %d\n", empp->exp);
        printf("Designation : %s\n", empp->designation);
        printf("Department : %s\n", empp->department);
        printf("Gross Salary : %d\n", empp->sal <= 20000 ? (empp->sal + (9 * (empp->sal / 100)) + (11 * (empp->sal / 100))) : empp->sal <= 30000 ? (empp->sal + (20 * (empp->sal / 100)) + (21 * (empp->sal / 100)))
                                                                                                                                                 : (empp->sal + (25 * (empp->sal / 100)) + (30 * (empp->sal / 100))));
        empp++;
    }

    return 0;
}

```
